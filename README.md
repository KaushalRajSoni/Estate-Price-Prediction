# Real Estate-Price-Prediction
## Project Description:
This project leverages machine learning to predict real estate prices based on various property features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and amenities. Using Scikit-Learn, I built a predictive model that helps estimate property prices with high accuracy, assisting buyers, sellers, and real estate investors in making data-driven decisions.

## Methodology:
Gathered real estate dataset with features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and price.
Cleaned data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing feature engineering.
Visualized relationships between features and price using Matplotlib.
Identified outliers and performed necessary transformations.
Feature Selection & Engineering.
Used correlation analysis and feature importance to select relevant features.
Applied standardization & normalization for better model performance.
Tried multiple models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Used Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for performance assessment.
Compared models and selected the best-performing one.
